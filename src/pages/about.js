                        The original idea to create a resource that will show tourists belarusian nature was born
                        in <span className={styles.marked}>2017</span>, when belarusian ecotourism was even less popular the now.
                        We were absolutely disagreed with this underestimation of the beauty of our nature and soon,
                        in <span className={styles.marked}>2018</span> we created a team that works on this project
                        till this day and constantly supplements and improves it.
                     </p>
