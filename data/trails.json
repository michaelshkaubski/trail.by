        "Yelnya is 25,301 hectares of nature, the balance of which was hardly disturbed by people, it is a wild, ancient place created to be written about legends and tales. This is the largest raised bog in Belarus and the fifth largest in Europe! Yelnya looks the traveler right into the heart of 118 lakes and provides shelter for 130 species of birds, including such rare ones as black-throated loons, white-tailed eagles and black storks (come here for birdwatching). The reserve has honestly earned its right to the status of Ramsar sites. The largest lake here is Yelnya, more than 5 square kilometers.",
        "Your path will run along the road for the swamp buggy - flooring of wire-bound logs. Walking along it is quite comfortable, but there is one danger: you can stare at the landscapes and fall through where the logs parted. They slip a little, so you should always look at your feet."

      "content2": [
        "And there is something to contemplate there: this feeling, when you leave a high birch forest, and the landscape opens up with the endless expanse of swamps, is difficult to compare with anything. Best of all to experience for yourself! All that will accompany you from here and further on the way is low twisted trees, lakes and moss full of water. There are also a lot of lingonberries, blueberries and blueberries, and closer to the camp, where the forest begins, edible mushrooms come across. ",
        "It is best to go to Yelnya in September. Then it is visually very beautiful here, because the leaves and grass turn yellow-red. At this time, here you can see cranes that stop in the swamp during their wintering flight to North Africa, Europe and Israel. From August to October, about 35 thousand cranes rest on Yelnya. Five to seven thousand birds can land on the swamp at the same time."

In some places it is so turbulent, and the channel is dotted with rapids, boulders and small waterfalls that it is impossible to distinguish it from mountain rivers at all.

It got its name not by chance, since there are practically no fish and little aquatic vegetation in its waters, and the water has a slightly yellowish tint of swamp drains. All this gives this place a mystical atmosphere.",
        "We continue along the ridge and soon find ourselves on an open top of a hill with the characteristic name of Bald Mountain. To view the area, a special tower is equipped with a fairly spacious observation deck, from where a view of Lake Glublya and a small, heart-shaped Lake Glubelka is opened, in the middle of which there is a small long island overgrown with pine trees tilted in different directions.",
